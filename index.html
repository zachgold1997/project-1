		<h4 class="intro">Hi. I'm Zach Goldstein!</h4>
					<p>First and foremost, I would like to introduce myself so that you may better know me. I am a website developer in the early stages of my career and a couple of my hobbies include a nearly unhealthy appreciation of cars and a love for Rock Climbing both indoor and out.</p>
          <p>For now let’s focus on who I am and we will get into my professional life later on. My love for automobiles started when my dad got me into Racing with his team as a pit crew/mechanic. This led to me buying a broken down truck for my first car and building it up by the time I got my license. Rock Climbing came soon after when a good friend of mine got me into Climbing at a gym he frequents and the hobby more than stuck.</p>

          <p>As a learning disabled kid I’ve always had trouble focusing on one thing but encoding this is turned from a problem to a blessing. I’m not only finish my project but I am constantly looking for ways to better the project and my knowledge of coding. Coding itself is similar to Legos in the sense that there are many very small pieces building into one huge final project.</p>

          <p>When I’m not Working you can often find me in front of a TV with a controller in my hand we’re out hiking about and Climbing at red rock in Las Vegas.  Many people only see Vegas for the gambling and adult entertainment but there really are many beautiful natural places to go hiking, camping or climbing in the Sin City.</p>
